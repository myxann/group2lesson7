                                Until the mid-1930s, only men in the Philippines had the right to vote. The 1935 Constitution initially restricted suffrage to male citizens aged 21 and above. However, it included a provision allowing women to vote if at least 300,000 qualified women approved it in a plebiscite.

                                            This led to <strong>Commonwealth Act No. 34</strong>, which facilitated a plebiscite on <strong>April 30, 1937</strong>. Nearly 500,000 women voted in favor, granting Filipino women the right to vote and run for office. Since then, women have played an active role in Philippine politics, including the election of two female presidents: <strong>Corazon Aquino (1986-1992) and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2001-2010).</strong>

                                            The <strong>1973 and 1987 Constitutions</strong> further expanded voting rights by lowering the voting age from 21 to <strong>18 years old</strong>. Today, Filipino women hold key positions across the government, including in the <strong>Senate, House of Representatives, Judiciary, and national commissions</strong>.

                                            Cory Aquino’s presidency was more than a political shift—it was a defining moment for women empowerment in politics. Breaking barriers in a male-dominated arena, she led the nation with <strong>strength, integrity, and compassion</strong>, proving that women could hold the highest office in the land.

                                            Her leadership saw the creation of the <strong>1987 Constitution</strong>, reinforcing democracy and securing civil liberties, including greater political participation for women. This paved the way for more women in government, highlighting their vital role in shaping the nation’s future.

                                            <strong>However</strong>, this also poses several challenges to the women in political environment such as <strong>limited family and societal support</strong>, that leads to <strong>fewer women than men run for public office</strong>, as well a woman running for politics are <strong>less encouraged unlike their male counterparts.</strong>

                                            Today, Aquino’s legacy stands as a testament to the power of women in leadership. Her presidency remains a milestone in the fight for <strong>gender equality</strong>, inspiring generations to take an active role in governance—not just as voters, but as leaders driving meaningful change.
